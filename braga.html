    <h2>Braga basics</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Braga is compact and walkable in the centre. You’ll notice the religious side (it’s famous for it),
      but the student life keeps the city awake and modern. If you want a base to explore the Minho
      without renting a car for every move, Braga is a strong choice.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Best area to stay</h3>
        <p>
          Stay near the historic centre if you want to walk everywhere. If you prefer quieter nights,
          choose a street a little outside the main squares, still within 10–15 minutes on foot.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>How to get around</h3>
        <p>
          The centre is made for walking. For Bom Jesus and nearby spots, buses and taxis are easy.
          If you’re doing Gerês in a day, a car helps — but for Braga + Guimarães you can manage without one.

        <h3>Good timing</h3>
        <p>
          Early mornings are calm and beautiful for photos. Late afternoons bring life back to cafés and terraces.
          Sundays can feel slower (sometimes very slow), so plan meals with that in mind.

<section id="walk" class="section section-alt">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>A simple walk you can do today</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      No complicated “route”. Just a loop that makes sense, works with kids, and leaves room for coffee breaks.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>1) Start in the centre</h3>
        <p>
          Begin where the city feels most “Braga”: stone streets, small shops, and people doing normal life.
          Walk slowly. Pick a café that looks busy with locals, not just tourists.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>2) Find a viewpoint or green space</h3>
        <p>
          When your feet need a pause, aim for a park or a higher point. Braga rewards small detours:
          shade, benches, and that quiet granite feeling you get in the Minho.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>3) End with Bom Jesus</h3>
        <p>
          If you have time, go to Bom Jesus. The classic staircase is worth it, but you don’t have to “conquer” it.
          Take it step by step, stop when you want, and enjoy the view at the top.

    <h2>Eating in Braga (without falling into tourist traps)</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      The best meals are often the simplest: a good soup, a daily plate, grilled meat or fish, and vinho verde.
      Look for places that feel like they serve people who work nearby.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>What to look for</h3>
        <p>
          A handwritten menu, a busy lunch hour, and a “prato do dia”. If everyone is ordering the same thing,
          that’s usually a good sign.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>What to try</h3>
        <p>
          Simple Minho classics: grilled meats, cod dishes, rice, seasonal vegetables, and local wine.
          If you’re with kids, most places can do small portions without drama.

    <h2>Easy day trips from Braga</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Braga sits in a great position. You can mix city time with rivers, villages, and historic centres without long drives.

        <h3>Guimarães</h3>
        <p>
          The medieval feeling, the castle area, and slow streets for walking. If you have one extra day in the Minho,
          this is the obvious pairing.

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Gerês</h3>
        <p>
          Waterfalls, river pools and mountain villages. For families, choose one simple area and don’t try to do everything.
          Gerês is better when you slow down.

        <h3>Small villages</h3>
        <p>
          The Minho is full of “normal” villages that don’t need a famous label. A market, a café, a church, and peace.
          Perfect if you want something real and quiet.
