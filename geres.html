        walk a little, swim a little, eat something simple… and let the place breathe.

    <h2>What Gerês really is (and what it isn’t)</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Peneda-Gerês is Portugal’s only national park. It’s not a theme park and it’s not a “one day checklist”.
      Roads are winding, distances take time, and the best moments often happen away from crowds.
      The smartest plan is: choose one zone per day.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Choose one area</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t try to drive everywhere. Pick one base area, then build your day around one walk + one water stop.
          You’ll spend less time in the car and more time actually enjoying nature.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Go early, leave space</h3>
        <p>
          Mornings are calmer and cooler. By midday, popular places fill up fast in summer.
          Start early, then keep the afternoon flexible: shade, water, snacks, slow pace.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Respect rules and locals</h3>
        <p>
          Some areas have restrictions (parking, access, fire risk). Follow signs and keep noise down.
          You’re visiting a living place — not just “scenery”.

  <div class="container">
    <h2>River time: the best part of summer</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      River beaches and natural pools are the real luxury here. The goal isn’t to “find the most famous spot”.
      The goal is shade, safe access, and clean water — especially if you’re with kids.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>How to pick a good spot</h3>
        <p>
          Look for easy entry/exit, shallow edges, and natural shade. If it feels slippery or too steep,
          it’s probably not worth it with children.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>What to bring</h3>
        <p>
          Water, snacks, sun protection, and something for rocky ground (water shoes help).
          A small trash bag is non-negotiable. Leave it cleaner than you found it.

          with notes for families.

    <h2>Walks that fit a slow day</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      You don’t need a hardcore hike to feel Gerês. A short forest walk, a viewpoint, a quiet path near water —
      that’s often enough.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Short & shaded</h3>
        <p>
          In summer, shade matters more than distance. Choose routes with trees and avoid long exposed climbs at midday.
          With kids, “less” usually means “better”.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Viewpoints</h3>
        <p>
          Combine one viewpoint stop with a calm river afternoon. That’s a full day without rushing.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Safety basics</h3>
        <p>
          Good shoes, water, and knowing when to turn back. Mobile signal can be patchy.
          If it’s very hot or there’s fire risk, keep walking minimal.

    <h2>Gerês with kids (realistic version)</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Gerês can be brilliant with children — if you plan for comfort, snacks and water, and avoid the “let’s do everything” trap.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Pick easy access</h3>
        <p>
          If parking is far and the path is steep, it becomes a battle. Choose places where you can carry less and sit more.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Build in breaks</h3>
        <p>
          A slow morning walk, then a long river stop, then an early dinner is often the perfect formula.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Food & bathrooms</h3>
        <p>
          Keep it simple: sandwiches, fruit, and one proper meal. Plan at least one stop where bathrooms exist.

    <h2>Combine Gerês with the rest of the Minho</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Gerês works best when you balance it with city time. Do nature days slower, then rest in Braga or Guimarães.

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Braga</h3>
        <p>A good base for cafés and easy meals — then drive into Gerês for a calm day.</p>
