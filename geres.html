        More than a national park, Gerês is where time slows down: cold rivers, granite villages, simple walks and days where silence matters more than schedules.

    <h2>Why Gerês feels different</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Gerês is Portugal’s only national park — but it’s not a theme park. No queues, no artificial viewpoints, no polished “experiences”. Just mountains, water, stone and silence.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Real nature</h3>
        <p>
          Mountains, waterfalls, deep valleys and clean river pools. Nothing curated — just pure landscape.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Silence that matters</h3>
        <p>
          On many trails you only hear the river and, far away, a church bell from a tiny village. A rare kind of quiet.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Its own pace</h3>
        <p>
          Gerês wasn’t built for rushing between attractions. If you come in a hurry, you miss the best part: slow days, long shadows and calm time outdoors.

    <h2>Slow travel in Gerês</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      The most important tip: don’t try to “see everything”. Gerês isn’t a checklist — it’s a place to return to, explore slowly and appreciate in small pieces.
    </p>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Pick one area</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of driving the entire park in one weekend, choose one valley, one village or one river area — and stay there.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>One trail, one swim, one meal</h3>
        <p>
          A good day in Gerês doesn’t need more: a simple walk, a fresh river dip and a comforting meal.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Leave space to return</h3>
        <p>
          It’s better to leave wanting more than to spend hours in the car rushing from spot to spot.
