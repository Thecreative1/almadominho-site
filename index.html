        <p class="section-intro">
          We are currently building a small, family-friendly place near Guimarães – surrounded
          by green, close to rivers and with space for kids to run.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is simple: honest comfort, local products, a barbecue space and an outdoor
          lifestyle that is hard to find in big cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Alma do Minho grows, this will become your direct booking page – no big platforms
          in the middle.

        <h2>Who is behind Alma do Minho?</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          I’m Flávio Martins – born in Portugal, lived more than twenty years in the
          Netherlands, and slowly moving back to the Minho with my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is my way of connecting what I love: simple rural life, good food,
          rivers, building things on the internet and helping people discover places that
          still feel authentic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alma do Minho is not a mass tourism project. It’s a long-term guide for people who
          want to travel slower, respect local life and maybe one day become our guests.
